# Game Box Cover Arts
As we already have a controllable frontend for dolphin (emulationstation), we want to be able to choose between games in a way that looks and presents the games nicely. Therefore, we want to show the games box cover art for each game within the game selection screen. 

## Gamelist.xml
RetroPie supports adding images to the corresponding games. However, you have to choose a suitable emulationstation theme that can display those images. 
RetroPie uses a file called: "`gamelist.xml`" to map images to specific games, creating an order how the games should be displayed and to describe where the games are located. 

**Note:** Place the image files that you want to use as the cover box art at "`/srv/media/`".

We now create the XML file at: `/home/<PRIMARY_USER>/RetroPie/roms/gc/gamelist.xml`.

Letâ€™s add the following contents to the file:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <gameList>
      <game id="1" source="">
          <path>./eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem.iso</path>
          <name>Eternal Darkness - Sanity's Requiem</name>
          <image>/srv/media/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem.jpg</image>
      </game>
      <game id="2" source="">
          <path>./fzero_gx.iso</path>
          <name>F-Zero GX</name>
          <image>/srv/media/fzero_gx.jpg</image>
      </game>
  </gameList>
```
As you can see each block gets its own ID which creates the ordering in which the games should be listed within the frontend selection screen.

Each block (`<game>`) also gets a few parameters:

- **path**
    - Specifies the directory path to the game itself.
- **name**
    - Specifies which name should be shown within the selection screen for the platform.
- **image**
    - Specifies the directory path to the `.jpg` file for the box cover art. Those files need to have the correct ownership as well as the gamelist.xml itself. (Primary User)

# Conclution
We configured RetroPie/emulationstation to show a box cover art for each game in the game selection screen. (If the used emulationstation theme supports it.) In addition, we now have an ordering in which the games should be listed.
