# Cleaning
This our final part of the project where we give the case itself a last cleaning.

## Cleaning
Cleaning the case should be done with isopropyl and microfiber fabric to avoid any kind of scratches especially for the logo plate. The logo plate can be removed by opening up the lid and carefully pressing down the two little black pieces inside the lid itself.

Right under the plate a lot of dust and dirt can be removed from a used GameCube. 

All sides of the cube should be cleaned/touched at least a bit with isopropyl.

The handle and the back of the handle also always houses much dust/dirt. This also applies to the hinge mechanism right above the handle where the lid is attached.

# Final Conclusion
We now have a cleaned game-cube system that consists of all features like they are described on the [documentation's introduction page](../../0%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Goals.md).
